Hello! - OK
My name is Katharine - OK, needs spelling (katharine is not recognised as name though)
I'm learning BSL level 1 - BSL is not seen as proper noun, need a rule to spell out words shorter than n that can be spelled out
Last time I practiced the topic "work" - OK
Now, today, I will try to use more facial expressions - use is still included, facial expressions is one word -> how to get it right?
Today, I will practice the topic "family" - OK
Who is my family? - OK
My parents live in Essex - actually translates to MY -M-F- LIVE (WHERE)[q] -E-S-S-E-X- vs MY PARENTS LIVE IN ESSEX
My dad's name is Mark - Index is between NAME and MARK for the topic, not required now i think
He works as a teacher part-time - if part and time are separate it's good, otherwise it's messed up
Before, he was an IT manager - OK
