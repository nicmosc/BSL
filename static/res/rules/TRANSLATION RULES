TRANSLATION RULES

We want to take the basis of the verb and from the POS tag obtain the analysis to apply to the sentence e.g. 

eats -> EAT [VBZ, present]

is eating -> EAT [present]

will eat -> EAT [future] 

has eaten -> EAT [past]

We only need to make 3 distinctions between past, present and future in order to set the time. Thus

VBZ, VBP = present
VBN, VBD = past
MD + VB = future (except would)

NOUN PHRASES

Determiners are removed
e.g. The car = CAR, That man = MAN

	NP				NP
 ___|_____		  __|__
DT 	X   NN	==	 NN	   X

i.e. if a NP starts with DT and ends with NN, DT disappears and NN goes at the start

PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES

Basically anything with IN will become a predicate + classifier e.g. an animal on the table = TABLE CL-TABLE ANIMAL CL-ANIMAL[LOC]

	PP			
 ___|__		  	 
IN 	   NP	==	?
