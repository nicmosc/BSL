MSc Project - Virtual BSL translation

## ABOUT 
An online translator from English to British Sign Language. It uses Python NLTK to translate the English string into a _gloss_ format which is then visualised with a virtual avatar. The avatar was created and animated in Blender, and the files are then combined and played back with three.js.
